       This document describes the <em>module for frequency, attestation and corpus information</em> of the Lexicon Model for Ontologies (<em>lemon</em>) as a result of the work of the Ontology Lexica community group (OntoLex). The module is targeted at complementing dictionaries and other linguistic resources containing lexicographic data with a vocabulary to express
	   <ul>
	   <li> corpus-derived statistics (frequency and cooccurrence information, collocations),</li>
	   <li> pointers from lexical resources to corpora and other collections of text (attestations),</li>
	   <li> the annotation of corpora and other language resources with lexical information (lemmatization against a dictionary), and</li>
	   <li> distributional semantics (collocation vectors, word embeddings, sense embeddings, concept embeddings).</li>
	   </ul>
	   The module tackles use cases in corpus-based lexicography, corpus linguistics and natural language processing, and operates in combination with the <em>lemon</em> core module, referred to as <em>OntoLex</em>, as well as with other <em>lemon</em> modules.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

	  <section>
	  <h3> Background and Motivation </h3>
      <p> The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/"><em>lemon</em> model</a> provides a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/#core">core</a> vocabulary (OntoLex) to represent <em>linguistic information</em> associated to ontology and vocabulary elements. The model follows the principle of <em>semantics by reference</em> in the sense that the semantics of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/#LexicalEntry">lexical entry</a> is expressed by reference to an individual, class or property defined in an ontology. </p>
	  
	  <p> The current version of <em>lemon</em> (as an outcome of the OntoLex group, sometimes referred as OntoLex-lemon in the literature) as well as its previous version (<a href="https://lemon-model.net/">lemon</a> [<cite><a href="#bib-lemon_paper">1</a></cite>]) have been increasingly used in the context of dictionaries and lexicographical data to convert existent lexicographic information into the standards and formats of the Semantic Web. In consequence, a designated <em>lemon</em> <a href="">module for lexicography</a> (<em>lexicog</em>) has been designed, with applications in monolingual [<cite><a href="#bib-klimek-kdict">2</a></cite>], bilingual [<cite><a href="#bib-gracia-apertium">3</a></cite>], and multilingual [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-kdict">4</a></cite>] dictionaries, as well as diachronic [<cite><a href="#bib-kahn-diachronic">5</a></cite>], dialectal [<cite><a href="#bib-declerck-dialectal">6</a></cite>], and etymological ones [<cite><a href="#bib-abromeit-etymological">7</a></cite>], among others.
	  This module is partially motivated by requirements of corpus-based lexicography (frequency and collocation information) and digital philology (linking lexical resources with corpus data).</p>
	  
	  <p> A second motivation for a <em>lemon</em> model for corpus-based information comes from natural language processing. With the rise of distributional semantics since the early 1990s, lexical semantics have been complemented by corpus-based co-occurrence statistics (KEYNESS-REFERENCE???), collocation vectors (Schütze 1993), word embeddings (Collobert et al. 2012) and sense embeddings (??? and Schütze, 2017). With the proposed module, <em>lemon</em> can serve as a community standard to encode, store and exchange vector representations (embeddings) along with the lexical concepts, senses, lemmas or words that they represent. The processing of word embeddings is beyond the scope of this module. Embeddings are thus represented as literals ("BLOB").</p>
	  
	  <p> The added value of using linked data technologies to represent such information is an increased level of interoperability and integration between different types of lexical resources, the textual data they pertain to, as well as distributional representations of words, lexical senses and lexical concepts. Creating a <em>lemon</em> module in the OntoLex CG is a suitable means for establishing a vocabulary on a broad consensus that takes into account all use cases identified above in an adequate fashion.	 
	<!--	From lexicog:  
	<p> After analysing the literature, the proposers of this module perceived an obvious need for reaching some agreement that allows for a better and more inter-operable migration of existing dictionaries into linked data [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-module">10</a></cite>]. For illustration, the OGL ontology [<cite><a href="#bib-parvizi-oxford">11</a></cite>] has its own notion of dictionary entry  materialised in the <tt>ogl:Entry</tt> class, while in [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-kdict">4</a></cite>] the ad-hoc  <tt>kd:dictionaryEntry</tt> relation was introduced in the conversion of the KD Multilingual Global Series dictionaries, i.e, different researchers introduced their own modelling solutions to account for similar notions. Being interoperability a key issue in linked data technologies, building a common space in which these concepts can be agreed on and commonly defined comes as a logical step.--> 
	The OntoLex community is the natural forum to accomplish this for several reasons: </p>

	   <ol>
		<li> The extended use of <em>lemon</em> to support digital lexicography,
		<li> the improved application and applicabiltiy of <em>lemon</em> in natural language processing,
		<li> the coming together of the lexicography, AI and human language technology communities, resp. resources, and
		<li> the possibility of reusing already available mechanisms in <em>lemon</em>, preventing researchers from "re-inventing the wheel",
	   </ol>

	  </section>
	  
	  <section> 
	  <h3> Aim and Scope </h3>

	  <p>
		The goal of this module is to complement <em>lemon</em> core elements with a vocabulary layer to represent lexicographical and semantic information derived from or defined with reference to corpora in a way that (a) <i>generalizes</i> over use cases from digital lexicography, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, computational philology and corpus linguistics, that (b) facilitates <i>exchange, storage and re-usability</i> of such data along with lexical information, 
		and that (c) <i>minimizes information loss</i>.
	  </p>

	<p> The scope of the model is three-fold:
		<ol>
			<li> extending the <em>OntoLex-lexicog</em> model with corpus information to support existing challenges in corpus-driven lexicography,</li>
			<li> modelling <em>existing</em> lexical and distributional-semantic resources (corpus-based dictionaries, collocation dictionaries, embeddings) as linked data, to allow their conjoint publication and inter-operation by Semantic Web standards, and
			<li> providing a conceptual / abstract model of relevant concepts in distributional semantics that facilitates building linked data-based applications that consume and combine both lexical and distributional information.
		</ol>
	
	<div class="note"><p>
		<em>Corpus</em> as used throughout this document is understood in its traditional, broader sense as a structured data collection -- or material suitable for being included into such a collection. 
		We do not intend to limit the use of the term to corpora in a linguistic or NLP sense. Language resources of any kind (web documents, dictionaries, plain text, unannotated corpora, etc.) are considered "corpus data" and a collection of such information as a "corpus" in this sense. Any information drawn from or pertaining to such information is considered "corpus-based".
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<!--
	lexicog:
	<div class="note"><p>
	In terms of applying the module, we propose the following best practice or "rule of thumb" ... :
		<ol>
			<li> As long as the entities in OntoLex and the other  <em>lemon</em> modules, together with those of catalogues of linguistic categories (e.g. LexInfo), suffice to represent the information encoded in the lexicographic resource (e.g., lexical entry, part of speech, translation, ...), the OntoLex lexicography module should not be instantiated.
			<li> In case that there is some lexicographic information that cannot be modelled by using either OntoLex or any of the other <em>lemon</em> modules (e.g., to denote sense ordering), then the model should be instantiated but avoiding duplicities and keeping extra information to the minimum.
		</ol>
	The reason behind this is that this module adds some complexity by providing additional description capabilities to the purely lexical description accounted by OntoLex. If this information is not needed for a specific conversion, i.e, if the lexicographical view is not key, reusing <em>lemon</em> would allow to keep the representation simpler but still sufficient.

	  <h3> ontolex:Element </h3>

	  	<p>
		We consider all <em>lemon</em> core concepts as being countable, annotatable/attestable and suitable for a numerical representation by means of a vector (embedding). For this reason, we define the rdfs:domain of all properties that link lexical and corpus information by means of ontolex:Element, an abstract superclass of 
		ontolex:Form (for word frequency and plain word/phrase embeddings),
		ontolex:LexicalEntry (for lemma frequency and lemma-based word/phrase embeddings), 
		ontolex:LexicalSense (for sense frequency and sense embeddings), and
		ontolex:LexicalConcept (for concept frequency and concept embeddings).

		<div class="note"><p>
		Such a top-level concept used to exist in <em>Monnet-lemon</em>, but has been abandoned in the 2016 edition of <em>lemon</em>.
		If this concept is not provided by a future revision of the <em>lemon</em> core vocabulary, it will be introduced by this module.
		Note that the introduction of ontolex:Element has no effect on <em>lemon</em> core other that facilitating vocabulary organization, as ontolex:Element is not to be used for data modeling.</p></div>

	<h3>Frequency</h3>
	
	<p> Frequency information is a crucial component in human language technology. Corpus-based lexicography originates with Francis and Kucera (1958), and subsequently, the analysis of frequency distributions of word forms, lemmas and other linguistic elements has become a standard technique in lexicography and philology, and given rise to the field of corpus linguistics.
	At its core, this means that lexicographers use corpus frequency and distribution information while compiling lexical entries (also see the section on collocations and similarity below). 
	As a qualitative assessment, frequency can be expressed with <a href="http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/2.0/lexinfo#frequency">lexinfo:frequency</a>, "[t]he relative commonness with which a term occurs". However, this is an object property with possible values lexinfo:commonlyUsed, lexinfo:infrequentlyUsed, lexinfo:rarelyUsed, while absolute counts over a particular resource (corpus) require novel vocabulary elements.
	</p>
	<p>
	Absolute frequencies are used in computational lexicography (e.g., the <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/epsd2/">Electronic Penn Sumerian Dictionary</a>), and they are an essential piece of information for NLP and corpus linguistics.
	In order to avoid confusion with lexinfo:Frequency, this is defined with reference to a particular dataset, a corpus.

	  <p>
	  The example shows orthographic variation (in the original writing system, Sumerian Cuneiform sux-Xsux, and its Latin transcription sux-Latn). It is slightly simplified insofar as the ePSD2 provides individual counts for different periods and that only three of six orthographical variants are given. Note that these are orthographical variants, not morphological variants (which are not given in the dictionary).
	  </p>
	  
	  <div class="note">
	  <p>It is necessary to provide the link to the underlying corpus <em>for every frequency assessment</em> because the same element may receive different counts over different corpora. For data modelling, it is recommended to define a corpus- or collection-specific subclass of frac:CorpusFrequency with a fixed dct:source value. This leads to more compact data and avoids potential difficulties with the Open World Assumption (interpretability of incomplete data).

	 <h3>Embeddings</h3>
	 
	 <p>In distributional semantics, the contexts in which a word is attested are taken to define its meaning. Contextual similarity is thus a correlate of semantic similarity. Different representations of context are possible, the most prominent model to date is the form of a vector.
	 A word vector can be created, for example, by means of a reference list of vocabulary items, where every reference word is associated with a fixed position, e.g., <i>ship</i> with position 1, <i>ocean</i> with 2, <i>sky</i> with 3, etc. 
	 Given a corpus (and a selection criterion for collocates, e.g., within the same sentence), every word in the corpus can be described by the frequency that a reference word occurred as a collocate in the corpus.
	 Assume we want to define the meaning of <i>frak</i>, with (exactly) the following attestations in our sample corpus (random samples from <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2003)">wikiquote</a>):
	 
	 <ul>
	 <li><i>It's in the frakking ship!</i></li>
	 <li><i>Have you lost your frakkin' mind?</i></li>
	 <li><i>Oh, for frak's sake, let me see if I can make heads or tails of it.</i></li>
	 <li><i>It's a frakking Cylon.</i></li>
	 <li><i>Our job isn't to be careful, it's to shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky!</i></li>
	 </ul>
	 
	 With the following list of reference words: <tt>(ship, ocean, lose, find, brain, mind, head, sky, Cylon, ...)</tt>, we obtain the vector <tt>(1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,2,...)</tt> for the lemma (lexical entry) <i>frak</i>. For practical applications, these vectors are projected into lower-dimensional spaces, e.g., by means of statistical (Schütze 1993) or neural methods (Socher et al. 2011). 
	 <!-- Socher, R., Huang, E. H., Pennin, J., Manning, C. D., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Dynamic pooling and unfolding recursive autoencoders for paraphrase detection. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 801-809). --> 
	 The process of mapping a word to a numerical vector and its result are referred to as "word embedding". Aside from collocation counts, other methods for creating word embeddings do exist, but they are always defined relative to a corpus.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>Embeddings have become a dominating paradigm in natural language processing and machine learning, but, if compiled from large corpora, they require long training periods and thus tend to be re-used. 
	 However, embedding distributions often use tool-specific binary formats (cf. <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html">Gensim</a>), and thus a portability problem arises. 
	 CSV and related formats (cf. <a href="https://github.com/baojie/senna/tree/master/embeddings">SENNA embeddings</a>) are a better alternative, but their application to sense and concept embeddings (as provided, for example, by Rothe and Schütze 2017) 
	 <!-- Rothe, S., & Schütze, H. (2017). Autoextend: Combining word embeddings with semantic resources. Computational Linguistics, 43(3), 593-617. -->
	 is problematic if their distribution is detached from the definition of the underlying sense and concept definitions.
	 With frac, Ontolex-lemon provides a vocabulary for the conjoint publication and sharing of embeddings and lexical information at all levels: non-lemmatized words (ontolex:Form), lemmatized words (ontolex:LexicalEntry), phrases (ontolex:MultiWordExpression), lexical senses (ontolex:LexicalSense) and lexical concepts (ontolex:LexicalConcept).</p>

	<section><h2>Collocations</h2>
	
	<div class="note"><p>CC: this is a part I am less certain about, mostly because of the rdf:List modelling (which is inspired by lexicog). Alternative suggestions welcome.</p></div>
	
	<p>Collocation analysis is an important tool for lexicographical research and instrumental for modern NLP techniques. It has been the mainstay of 1990s corpus linguistics and continues to be an area of active research in computational philology. ... (MORE MOTIVATION AND EXAMPLES)</p>
	
	<p>Collocations are usually defined on surface-oriented criteria, i.e., as a relation between forms or lemmas (lexical entries), not between senses, but they can be analyzed on the level of word senses (the sense that gave rise to the idiom or collocation). Indeed, collocations often contain a variable part, which can be represented by a <tt>ontolex:LexicalConcept</tt>.</p>
	
	<p>Collocations can involve two or more words, they are thus modelled as an <tt>rdf:List</tt> of <tt>ontolex:Element</tt>s.
	Collocations may have a fixed or a variable word order. By default, we assume variable word order, where a fixed word order is required, the collocation must be assigned <tt>lexinfo:termType lexinfo:idiom</tt>.</p>
	
	<p>Collocations obtained by quantitative methods are characterized by their method of creation (<tt>dct:description</tt>), their collocation strength (<tt>rdf:value</tt>), and the corpus used to create them (<tt>dct:source</tt>). Collocations share these characteristics with other types of contextual relations (see below), and thus, these are inherited from the abstract <tt>frac:ContextualRelation</tt> class.</p>

	Collocations are lists of ontolex:Elements, and formalized as <tt>rdf:List</tt>. Collocation elements can thus be directly accessed by <tt>rdf:first</tt>, <tt>rdf:_1</tt>, <tt>rdf:_2</tt>, etc. The property <tt>rdf:rest</tt> returns a <tt>rdf:List</tt> of <tt>ontolex:Element</tt>s, but not a <tt>frac:Collocation</tt>.</p>
	
	<p>By default, <tt>frac:Collocation</tt> is insensitive to word order. If a collocation is word order sensitive, it should be characterized by an appropriate <tt>dct:description</tt>, as well as by having <tt>lexinfo:termType lexinfo:idiom</tt>.</p>

	<div class="note">
	<p><tt>lexinfo:idiom</tt> is ``[a] group of words in a fixed order that have a particular meaning that is different from the meanings of each word understood on its own.'' In application to automatically generated collocations, the criterion of having `a particular meaning' is necessarily replaced by `a particular distribution pattern', as reflected by the collocation weight (<tt>rdf:value</tt>). <i>Idioms</i> in the narrower sense of lexicalized multi-word expressions should not be modelled as <tt>frac:Collocation</tt>s, but as <tt>ontolex:MultiWordExpression</tt>s.

	<h2>Similarity</h2>
	
	<p>Similarity is a paradigmatic contextual relation between elements that can replace each other in the same context. In distributional semantics, a quantitative assessment of the similarity of two forms, lexemes, phrases, word senses or concepts is thus grounded in numerical representations of their respective contexts, i.e., their embeddings.
	In a broader sense of `embedding', also bags of words fall under the scope of <tt>frac:Embedding</tt>, see the usage note below.
	</p>
	
	<p>Similarity is characterized by a similarity score (<tt>rdf:value</tt>), e.g., the number of shared dimensions/collocates (in a bag-of-word model) or the cosine distance between two word vectors (for fixed-size embeddings), the corpora which we used to generate this score (<tt>dct:source</tt>), and the method used for calculating the score (<tt>dct:description</tt>).</p>
	
	<p>Similarity is symmetric. The order of similes is irrelevant.</p>
	
	<p>Like <tt>frac:Collocation</tt>, quantitative similarity relations are modelled as a subclass of <tt>frac:ContextualRelation</tt> (and thus, as an <tt>rdf:List</tt>. Quantitative similarity relations are different from collocations in that they provide a different score for every pair of similes. However, one possible application of <tt>frac:Similarity</tt> is to represent synonym groups (as derived from a particular corpus), which may contain more than two similes.

	  </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  In both (and similar) cases, the recommendation is to make use of (a resource-specific subclass of) <tt>frac:Embedding</tt>, nevertheless, and to document the specifics of the similarity relation in the <tt>dct:description</tt> of these embeddings. For the first use case, this approach can be justified by assuming that embeddings are correlated with a psycholinguistically `real' phenomenon.

	  <section>
	  <h3>Resource-specific subclasses of frac concepts</h3>
		<p>As corpus-derived information requires provenance and other metadata, the frac module uses reification (class-based modelling) for concepts such as frequency or embeddings. In a data set, this information will be recurring, and for redundancy reduction, we recommend to provide resource-specific subclasses of frac concepts that provide metadata by means of <tt>owl:Restriction</tt>s that provide the value for the respective properties. This was illustrated above for the relevant frac classes.</p>
		
		<p>
		As a rule of best practice, we recommend for such cases to provide (a copy of) the OWL definitions of resource-specific classes <em>in the same graph (and file) as the data</em>.
		Within the graph containing the data, the following SPARQL 1.1 query <em>must</em> return the full frac definition of all instances of, say, <tt>:EPSDFrequency</tt> (see examples above):
		</p>
		
		<p><div class="beispiel"><div><pre><code>
CONSTRUCT {
	?data a ?class, ?sourceClass; ?property ?value.
} WHERE {
  ?data a ?sourceClass.	                  # e.g., [] a :EPSDFrequency
  ?sourceClass (rdfs:subClassOf|owl:equivalentClass)* ?class.
  FILTER(strstarts(str(?class),'http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/frac#'))
    # ?class: all superclasses of ?sourceClass which are in the <em>frac</em> namespace
  { # return all value restrictions
	  ?class (rdfs:subClassOf|owl:equivalentClass)* ?restriction.
	  ?restriction a owl:Restriction.
	  ?restriction owl:onProperty ?property.
	  ?restriction owl:hasValue ?value.
  } UNION {
    # return all directly expressed values
	  ?data ?property ?value.
	  FILTER(?property in (dct:source,rdf:value))
	  # TODO: update list of properties
  }
}</code></pre></div></div></p>

	<p>This query can be used as a test for <em>frac</em> compliancy, and for property `inference'. Note that it does not support <tt>owl:intersection</tt> nor <tt>owl:join</tt>, nor <tt>owl:sameAs</tt>.</p>
  
	<div class="note">
	<p>We use the OWL2/DL vocabulary for modelling restrictions. However, <em>lemon</em> is partially compatible with OWL2/DL only in that several modules use <tt>rdf:List</tt> -- which is a reserved construct in OWL2. Therefore, the primary means of accessing and manipulation <em>lemon</em> and <em>ontolex-frac</em> data is by means of SPARQL, resp., RDF- (rather than OWL-) technology. In particular, we do not guarantee nor require that OWL2/DL inferences can be used for validating or querying <em>lemon</em> and <em>ontolex-frac</em> data.
